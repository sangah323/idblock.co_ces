## 💬 Real Questions, Real Impact

Our booth became a space for real conversation:

- “**Can IDBlock really work without borders?**”
- “**How is B·Pay different from existing payment systems?**”
- “**How does it align with GDPR and European standards?**”

We didn’t just present — we demonstrated  
how CrossHub builds **digital trust infrastructure** for the global era.
