# 🇷🇸 Crosshub Opens New Chapter of Global Collaboration in Serbia

With the strong support of BIPA and the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Serbia, Crosshub had the opportunity to join the **Global Collaboration Program** in Belgrade and Novi Sad. This journey allowed us to meet local companies face-to-face, listen to the voices of the Serbian market, and explore how our identity and payment infrastructure can be applied in real-world contexts.

## 🤝 Achievements and Partnerships

The strong interest and feedback from local stakeholders confirmed the potential of the Serbian market and gave us valuable insights to refine our global expansion strategy.

During the program, we successfully **signed four MOUs with leading Serbian companies**, laying the foundation for long-term partnerships. We also met with representatives from the National Assembly, government institutions, and the Embassy to understand the regulatory landscape and potential areas of collaboration.

## 🏢 Innovation Ecosystem Exploration

Visiting the IT and gaming industry cluster in Novi Sad gave us a deeper appreciation of the country's innovation ecosystem. In addition, our IR pitching and networking sessions on the global stage created momentum for future investment and partnership opportunities.

## 🌍 Realizing Global Vision

Most importantly, this trip helped Crosshub secure valuable global references and reaffirmed the strong demand for trusted solutions in identity verification and cross-border payments.

Building on these achievements, we will continue to strengthen our partnerships in Serbia and beyond, moving forward with our vision of becoming a global infrastructure for identity and payments.

**The journey has just begun, and we look forward to creating borderless trust together.**
