## 🎬 Highlights from the 2025 K-Tourism Roadshow in Kaohsiung 🇹🇼

From May 30 to June 1, CrossHub joined the **2025 K-Tourism Roadshow** at the **Pier-2 Art Center in Kaohsiung, Taiwan**!  
We showcased **IDBlock** and **B·Pay**, our innovative technologies for seamless global identity verification and cross-border payments.

Over three exciting days, hundreds of visitors stopped by our booth, engaged with our team, and discovered new possibilities through hands-on demos and conversations.
