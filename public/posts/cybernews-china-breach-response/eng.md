## 🚨 4 Billion Records Leaked

According to [CyberNews](https://cybernews.com/security/chinese-data-leak-billiones-records-exposed/), over **4 billion personal data records** primarily belonging to Chinese citizens were recently exposed.

This is one of the **largest leaks involving a single nation**, and it's being seen as a wake-up call for the **global cybersecurity infrastructure**.

## 💥 What Was Leaked?

The compromised data includes highly sensitive information such as:

- **Names, phone numbers, and addresses**
- **Passport numbers and national ID information**

## 📉 3 Major Threats This Incident Highlights

1. **Limitations of centralized security systems**  
   A single breach can compromise the identity of billions

   Users no longer feel their information is safe

3. **Declining credibility of service providers**  
   Reputational damage, user loss, and legal accountability follow

## 🔐 CrossHub Thinks Differently

We believe "**Identity is a human right.**"  
And such rights **can no longer rely solely on centralized entities.**

CrossHub secures both privacy and usability with:

- **IDBlock**: User-owned identity storage and verification
- **B·Pay**: Payment flow without external identity exposure
- **Decentralized authentication architecture**
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** approach (planned)

## 🌍 Building a Better Trust Infrastructure

Among the 4 billion affected, someone may have lost critical rights due to a single breach.

We aim to **redefine trust through technology** and **return control of identity to users.**

> CrossHub doesn’t just offer security.  
> We design trust.
