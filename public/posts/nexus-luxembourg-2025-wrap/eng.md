## 💬 It's Not About Numbers — It's About People, Ideas, and Momentum

We always believe that  
"True success isn't measured by numbers, but by the energy created by people and ideas coming
together."

This event gave us the chance to discuss the future of **IDBlock** and **B·Pay**, and to share our
vision for a **trust-based, borderless digital ecosystem**.
